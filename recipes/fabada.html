    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is nothing more comforting when winter comes around than a heaping bowl of fabada Asturiana, a delicious white bean and chorizo stew typical of northern Spain (Asturias). A typical Spanish fabada recipe includes huge white beans, called fabes, and what I like to call "the holy trinity"-- morcilla (blood sausage), chorizo (paprika spiced sausage), and tocino (pork belly). These ingredients are often sold together in one vacuum sealed package, making preparation even easier.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Approx. 400g 15oz of large white beans (when drained and rinsed)</li>
        <li>1 small link of sweet semi-cured Spanish chorizo note: this is not completely raw chorizo. If that's all you can get, you'll have to sear it before using. Also, it's not literally sweet, but rather made with sweet versus spicy paprika.</li>
        <li>1 small link of spicy semi-cured Spanish chorizo</li>
        <li>1 small link of Spanish semi-cured blood sausage morcilla</li>
        <li>100 g Â¼ lb of cured pork belly (pancetta or tocino)</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>1 small potato</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic smashed (but not minced)</li>
        <li>600 ml 2.5 cups of water (or ham stock if you have it!)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and dice the onion, potato, and carrot.</li>
        <li>If using completely fresh meats (ideally you can find the semi-cured ones we use here in Spain), you'll have to sea them on all sides.</li>
        <li>If using the semi-cured meats, poke the sausages with a fork so that the casing doesn't burst once cooking.</li>
        <li>Put the meats and vegetables into a large pot, along with the smashed garlic clove and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Cover the ingredients with water (or stock) and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a rapid simmer, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the beans in a strainer and reserve (don't add yet).</li>
        <li>Take out the meats and put on a plate. Discard the garlic clove and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Blend the vegetables and broth to create a thick soup. Season with salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Cut up the meats into bite-sized chunks and add them back to the broth.</li>
        <li>Add the beans and cook everything together over a slow heat for about five minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy immediately, or serve later for even more flavor!</li>
    </ol>
