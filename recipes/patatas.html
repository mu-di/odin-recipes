    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As the name suggests, Patatas a la Riojana is a classic Spanish stew from Rioja made with potatoes and Spanish chorizo slowly simmered in caramelised onions, garlic and finished with choricero pepper puree. It is the perfect dish when you are craving a hearty, warming meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5Kg red potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>300g spicy cooking chorizo, cut into one-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large red onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green pepper, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of choricero pepper puree</li>
        <li>1.5 ltr of water</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cutting the potatoes into irregular chunks. The best way is to cut into the potato and then break it off with the knife as this helps release the starch which in turn will help thicken the stew.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large casserole dish or stew pot and add the chopped red onion, garlic and green pepper and cook on a gentle heat for 10 minutes or until soft. Add the chorizo pieces and fry gently for a further 5 minutes until lightly brown. Add the potatoes, stir with a wooden spoon, and cook for a further 5 minutes to allow the potatoes to release their starch.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water to cover the potatoes, add the bay leaf and bring the patatas to the boil. Once they start boiling, lower the heat, season with salt and cook on a moderate heat moving the pot now and again for the potatoes to thicken the stew. The potatoes should take about 20 minutes to cook but check to ensure they are still not hard. In the last 5 minutes, check the seasoning and add the pimiento choricero puree.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and put a lid on the pot and leave for 5 minutes to rest. Serve immediately with some crusty bread and a glass of rioja!</li>
