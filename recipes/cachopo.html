    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It consists of two large veal fillets and includes ham and cheese, and typically has a side of french fries (known there as "patatas fritas"). The dish is eaten fried and hot after being breaded in eggs and breadcrumbs, and it is usually served garnished with potatoes, peppers, or mushrooms.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large beef fillets</li>
        <li>Serrano ham</li>
        <li>Sliced cheese</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Wheat</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>Virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>We beat the 6 eggs. We throw them in a large rectangular bucket-the size of this will depend on the size of the fillets.</li>
        <li>In one dish, we spread out one of the fillets by hand.</li>
        <li>Place the slices of cheese on top, which cover all the fillet well, the more generous we are, the richer it will be.</li>
        <li>Place the Serrano ham, which also covers all the cheese.</li>
        <li>Put the second filet of beef on top.</li>
        <li>In a bucket we have the flour, put our cachopo and flour well.</li>
        <li>Then we put our cachopo in the bowl of beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>We passed the cachopo to the breadcrumbs and we plowed.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat the oil, when it is very hot we put the cap. We brown well.</li>
    </ol>
